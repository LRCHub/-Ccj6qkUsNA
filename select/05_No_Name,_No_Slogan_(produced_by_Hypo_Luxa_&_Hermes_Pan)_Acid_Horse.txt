Unquestioning, undaunting
The silence of language
Anonymous hands
With a nameless device

No name, no slogan
No name, no slogan

It's safe to say
The attention span is intact
Undivided, oblivious eyes outside
Shall remain unenlightened
Information regurgitated
And forced into machines

No name, no slogan
No name, no slogan

Attention cycle, never broken
No name, no slogan
Anonymous eyes
Shall never open

No name, no slogan
No name, no slogan

Here the edge is thin
And skin is far too thin
So thin the device divides
And cuts up time and again

No name, no slogan
No name, no slogan
