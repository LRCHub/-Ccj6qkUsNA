Unquestioning, undaunting
The silence of language
Anonymous hands
With a nameless device
No name, no slogan
No name, no slogan
No name, no slogan
No name, no slogan
It's safe to say
The attention span is intact
Undivided
Oblivious eyes outside
Shall remain unenlightened
Information regurgitated
And forced into machines
No name, no slogan
No name, no slogan
Attention cycle never broken
No name, no slogan
Anonymous eyes shall never open
No name, no slogan
No name, no slogan
Here, the edge is thin
And skin is far too thin
So thin the device divides
And cuts up time
And again...
No name, no slogan
No name, no slogan
No name, no slogan
No name, no slogan
